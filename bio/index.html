    <h3>Hi, I'm Stephen. I'm a Full-stack<br>
        Developer and STEAM enthusiast.
    </h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I am a Thinkful Full-stack Flex 
        Program graduate. I enjoy a good 
        challenge. My passion is creating 
        interactive webpages that 
        run seamlessly. I have been building 
        apps in JavaScript, Java and Python 
        for about ten years. I have hosted
        blog sites, the most recent being for 
        my non-profit organization, 
        Mathemagical.org. Another 
        is TechCrowdBacking.com. 
        I also taught Secondary Mathematics in 
        inner-city schools for 5 years. 
        In that time, I’ve had the pleasure of 
        teaching everything from 7th grade 
        mathematics to Second-year Advanced 
        Placement Calculus. I enjoyed my job, 
        and I loved the difference I made in 
        the lives of children. 
        <br><br>
        
        &emsp;&emsp;However, I made a change to 
        go into web development for many reasons.
        As the Founder of Mathemagical.org, I 
        tutor children free of charge and am 
        building out the online platform with 
        the hope of one day rivaling Khan 
        Academy. Similarly, TechCrowdBacking.com
        offers a forum for financial education
        with the opportunity for users to talk
        about tech and the companies producing
        that tech. I am an artist, and the web 
        is my gallery.
        <br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;I have been studying all my life.
        I am passionate about learning. 
        I enjoy self-improvement immensely. 
        In my free-time, I enjoy reading, 
        watching, thinking about Science and 
        Technology, and realistic Science-
        fiction, watching news, day-trading 
        stocks and general tinkering. Some of 
        my past projects have included 
        hydroponic gardening, building an open-
        source 3-d printer, building PC’s, and 
        of course, building apps and websites. 
        I enjoy inspiring others to set goals 
        and helping them reach those goals. I 
        love to learn.
